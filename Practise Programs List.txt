1)list_1= [1,2,5,3,9,5,26,53,95,] , output should be the list and first index should be divided by second like respectively

2)list_1= [1,2,5,3,9,5,26,53,95,] print list in reverse order(Prog_ListReverse.py)

3)Write a code that all 0's in the list should move to right-side , list_1= [8,0,0,65,79,0,21,0,0,0,54,12](Prog_List_allzerosalignRight.py)

4)String= "ffgyytuuugg" write a code to print that first unique character and position of that character

5)list_1 = [1,2,10,3,4,2,5,6,8,9,11] write a code to print 1st & 2nd largest number from the list(Prog_1&2Large_List.py)



6)Input ⇒ Welcome Yagna!  ,   given input string should be reversed, but the condition is that last
                            special character and space between the words should be in its
                            index position even after reversing the string
 this is the expected output
Output ⇒ angaYem ocleW!


7)In given string vowels should be replaced with numbers, do it with for loop and Regex

8)list_1=[1,12,3,4,4,3,2,5,6,5,6] write a program to print without repeated values from the list(List_without_Repeated.py)

9)String_1="986758h49ghsdfe#$%@3h4" using Regex and looping get only numbers as output
 
 
10)Input= [(2, 3), (4, 5), (6, 7), (2, 8)] each tuple should be multiply and output should be in list as below
	Output: [6, 20, 42, 16]
	

11)Write a program using while loop to print prime numbers in between the range of given numbers(Prog_while_PrimeNumbers_withinrange.py)

12)Using re write a program to validate ip address

13)Write a program to count the duplicate characters in a string(string_count_duplicates.py)

14)Read the file and print whether the given word is available or not

15)Write a program for palindrome number and as well as word(Prog_palindrome.py)

16)dict_1={1:2,2:4,3:6,4:8} write a program for swapping keys as values and viceversa(Dict_swapping.py)


17)Print unique elements from the list

18)Read 5 integer numbers using a single statement,without using loops

19)Print a given word 5 times, with loop and without using loop(prog_read5integers_withoutloop.py)####Pending#####

20)Write a program to count each element from the list that how many times each element was repeated(key:value)

21)String1 = 'AB23GWS58TDE789WSC234MNO97899AD2BO' can you get the maximum number from the string using Regex

22)tuple=(3,4,1,5,2) sort the elements output=(1,2,3,4,5)

23)Write a program on fibonacci series(Prog_fibonacci.py)

24)Write a program on factorial (Prog_factorial.py)

25)Write program on list find sum of highest last three nums?
	
26)Take nested dictonary dict_1 = {"a": 1, "b": 2, "c":3, "d":{"f":4, "r":5, "g": 6}, "f":{"g":5}} i want value 6?	
	
27)Write function, pass an arugument as string in that count vowels?

28)Write function, pass an arugument as string in that count consonats?	
	
29)Convert list of elements to string?	(ListTo_string.py)
