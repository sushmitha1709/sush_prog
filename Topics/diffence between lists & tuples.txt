diffence between lists & tuples:
			LIST					TUPLE
1	Lists are mutable					Tuples are immutable

2	Implication of iterations is Time-consuming		The implication of iterations is comparatively Faster

3	The list is better for performing operations, 		Tuple data type is appropriate for accessing the elements
		such as insertion and deletion.	
4	Lists consume more memory				Tuple consume less memory as compared to the list

5	Lists have several built-in methods			Tuple does not have many built-in methods.

6	The unexpected changes and errors are more likely	In tuple, it is hard to take place.	to occur	


Difference Between List and Tuple in Python(BYJUS)
Here is a list of the differences between List and Tuple in Python.

Parameters			List								Tuple

Type		A list is mutable in nature.				A tuple is immutable in nature.

Consumption 
of Memory	It is capable of consuming more memory.			It is capable of consuming less memory.

Time 
Consumption	The list iteration is more time-consuming. 		The tuple iteration is less time-consuming
		It is comparatively much slower than a tuple.		 It is comparatively much faster than a list.

Methods		It comes with multiple in-built methods.		These have comparatively lesser built-in methods in them.

Appropriate 
Usage		It is very helpful in the case of deletion and 		It is comparatively helpful in the case of read-only operations
		insertion operations.	 				such as accessing elements.
