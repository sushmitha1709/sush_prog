input (): 
	This function first takes the input from the user and converts it into a string. The type of the returned object always 
	will be <type ‘str’>. It does not evaluate the expression it just returns the complete statement as String. 
	For example, Python provides a built-in function called input which takes the input from the user. 
	When the input function is called it stops the program and waits for the user’s input. When the user presses enter, 
	the program resumes and returns what the user typed. 
raw_input():
 	This function works in older version (like Python 2.x). This function takes exactly what is typed from the keyboard, 
	converts it to string, and then returns it to the variable in which we want to store it.
The split():
	the method in Python returns a list of strings after breaking the given string by the specified separator.
	This function helps in getting multiple inputs from users. It breaks the given input by the specified separator. 
	If a separator is not provided then any white space is a separator. Generally, users use a split() method to split 
	a Python string but one can use it in taking multiple inputs.

	Syntax : 

		input().split(separator, maxsplit) 
	# taking multiple inputs at a time 
		x = [int(x) for x in input("Enter multiple values: ").split()]
		print("Number of list is: ", x)
Python print():
	 function prints the message to the screen or any other standard output device.

		Syntax: print(value(s), sep= ‘ ‘, end = ‘\n’, file=file, flush=flush)

end == "":
	In python, by default print() ends with new line "\n". But we don't want to print two print() statements in single line. In that case 
	we can use "end" parameter in print().
	print("geeks", end =" ")
	print("geeksforgeeks")		o/p:"geeks geeksforgeeks",
