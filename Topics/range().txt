range():
	The range() function is used to generate a sequence of numbers. range() is a built-in function of Python
			(OR)
	Python range() function returns the sequence of the given number between the given range.
	range() in Python(3.x) is just a renamed version of a function called xrange in Python(2.x).
	The most common use of range() function in Python is to iterate sequence type (Python range() List, string, etc. ) 
	with for and while loop.
 
	Python range syntax:
		range(stop)

		range(start, stop, step)
	There are three ways you can call range() : 
		range(stop) takes one argument.
		range(start, stop) takes two arguments.
		range(start, stop, step) takes three arguments.
	Python range() function doesnâ€™t support the float numbers. i.e. user cannot use floating-point or non-integer number in any 
	of its argument.Users can use only integer numbers. 
	
	For example 
	# using a float number
	for i in range(3.3):
    	print(i)
	o/p:for i in range(3.3):
	TypeError: 'float' object cannot be interpreted as an integer

	Points to remember about Python range() function : 

	range() function only works with the integers i.e. whole numbers.
	All arguments must be integers. Users can not pass a string or float number or any other type in a start, stop and step argument of a range().
	All three arguments can be positive or negative.
	The step value must not be zero. If a step is zero python raises a ValueError exception.
	range() is a type in Python
	Users can access items in a range() by index, just as users do with a list:
